First Look at Redux

For this project I used the create-react-app command to generate a scaffold with all the necessary React dependencies and scripts. Check out the npm docs

For details on what the scripts are doing behind the senes, check out the react-scripts documentation
Project Setup

Because we are using the create-react-app setup, there is no need to run npm install.

Kick things off directly with:
npm start

Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app in a browser.

The page is setup with hot-reload so it will reload automatically if you make changes.
